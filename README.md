# Microsoft Teams & Outlook Calendar Integration API


# Microsoft Teams & Outlook Calendar Integration via Microsoft Graph API

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A complete implementation for seamless integration with Microsoft Teams and Outlook Calendar using Microsoft Graph API. This solution enables programmatic creation and management of online meetings and calendar events through Azure AD-registered applications.

## Features

- 🔐 Secure Azure AD integration with OAuth2 client credentials flow
- 📅 Automated scheduling of Microsoft Teams meetings
- 🗓️ Dynamic creation of Outlook Calendar events
- 👥 Support for multiple attendees and organizers
- ✅ Comprehensive validation of organizer permissions and licenses
- 🔄 Isolated permissions with separate Azure AD apps for Teams and Outlook

## Prerequisites

- Azure Active Directory tenant
- Two registered Azure AD applications (one for Teams, one for Outlook)
- Admin rights to grant application permissions
- .NET 6.0 or later

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Azure AD Application Configuration

Create two applications in Azure AD:

#### Outlook Integration App
- Required permissions:
  - `Calendars.ReadWrite` (Application)
  - `User.Read.All` (Application, optional)

#### Teams Integration App
- Required permissions:
  - `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All` (Application)
  - `User.Read.All` (Application, optional)

Remember to grant admin consent for all permissions.

### 2. Configuration

Update `appsettings.json` with your credentials:

```json
{
  "AzureAdOutlook": {
    "ClientId": "YOUR_OUTLOOK_APP_ID",
    "TenantId": "YOUR_TENANT_ID",
    "ClientSecret": "YOUR_OUTLOOK_SECRET"
  },
  "AzureAdTeams": {
    "ClientId": "YOUR_TEAMS_APP_ID",
    "TenantId": "YOUR_TENANT_ID",
    "ClientSecret": "YOUR_TEAMS_SECRET"
  }
}
```
## 3. Validation Logic

The system validates that:

- The organizer exists in Azure AD
- The organizer has active Teams and Exchange Online licenses
- The application has the required Microsoft Graph permissions
- All necessary configurations are properly set

```csharp
/* Meeting organizer's email:
   ------------------------------------ */
var organizer = dados.Organizador;
/* ------------------------------------
Before setting the organizer's email above, ensure that:

1. The user exists in the Azure AD tenant;
2. The user has active licenses for Microsoft Teams and Exchange Online;
3. The application (ClientId/ClientSecret) has the required permissions;
*/
```

## Usage

After configuration, you can:

- Create Teams meetings programmatically
- Manage Outlook calendar events
- Set different users as meeting organizers
- Handle multiple attendees and complex meeting scenarios
